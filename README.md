# Sponsorship Package

## Cash Sponsors:
Code & Coffee Vancouver offers one benefits tier to any and all cash sponsors.  We will accept a "12
Month Exclusive Sponsor" only if all other cash sponsorships at the time are "Month to Month". In the
event that an exclusive sponsor is secured, Code and Coffee Vancouver will not entertain any other
cash sponsorship agreements for the duration of the 12 month term.

Each sponsor is provided with the following benefits:
- Logo on the meetup home page, sponsors page, and event pages at meetup.com (link above)
- Company write up in the event invitation (a monthly email to more than 3200 programmers and tech enthusiasts)
- Company marketing materials distributed at each event
- Personalized mention by our MC at each event

Future considerations in the pipeline:
- Logo on Code & Coffee Vancouver website
- Logo placement (via video editing) on our recorded talks from each event
